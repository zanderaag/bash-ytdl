# bash-ytdl
A command-line interface to interact with the youtube-dl utility.

Special thanks to the team at youtube-dl for creating such an amazing tool. Without you this project of mine would not even be possible. 
You can find them here:
https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ and/or 
https://youtube-dl.org/

This program uses wget, ffmpeg and youtube-dl as dependencies. Other dependencies such as package managers are variables
based on your distribution.

This program is meant for fun and not to be used in any malicious ways or for profit, so use it accordingly!

Please note that due to dependancies and issues with version control on my end, this script does not work for CentOS8! I will someday re-write this entirely in Python to make it better, till then... :)
